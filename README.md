# ðŸ’ª Qt C++ Library

This is a Qt C++ Library Management app. 
Its main goal is to showcase the programmer's ability to work with C++ OOP concepts, especially polymorphism (ðŸ’€).

This is to say, I coded this because of a university assignment.

Enjoy :)

## ðŸ’¼ "Back-end" and Business Logic

### Models, Views and Controllers

See models, views and controllers folders.

### Visitors, CLI and db

Same as above, see folder names. Pretty easy to figure out everything.

## ðŸŽ¨ "Front-end" and User Experience

### UX and Navigation Flow

This navitation flow is heavily inspired (aka copied) by the RESTful routing pattern adopted by Ruby On Rails.
I love Ruby On Rails.

| Action         | REST Route          | View Transition             |
| -------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| List all items | GET /items          | â†’ IndexView                 |
| Show item      | GET /items/:id      | IndexView â†’ ShowItemView    |
| New item form  | GET /items/new      | IndexView â†’ NewItemView     |
| Edit item form | GET /items/:id/edit | ShowItemView â†’ EditItemView |
| Create item    | POST /items         | NewItemView â†’ IndexView     |
| Update item    | PUT /items/:id      | EditItemView â†’ ShowItemView |
| Delete item    | DELETE /items/:id   | ShowItemView â†’ IndexView    |

## TODO

- [x] Create `NewItemView` page  
  - [x] Create an `ItemFormVisitor` that returns different types of form based on the item type  
    - [x] Take inspiration from the `ItemCardVisitor` to handle state  
  - [x] The form sends a signal that triggers a private slot that sends a signal up when it creates a new item  
  - [x] The signal is intercepted by the `NewItemView` class that triggers a private slot that propagates the signal  
  - [x] The signal is intercepted by the `MainWindow` that simply creates the new item
```
How can I differentiate between the various types?  
Maybe create the object at the level of the form returned by the `ItemFormWidget`, then simply pass the pointer up to the parents?  
This could be a decent idea, I hope (it was, I hope, again)
